## Hi, I'm Huw ðŸ‘‹
Experienced Geospatial Data Scientist with a focus on Python-based remote sensing and data processing.

- #### Current Research:
  Collaborating with researchers at the University of Washington to enhance an interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) workflow, improving automation, data management, and geospatial data processing.
- #### Previous Experience:
  Led the development of a Python-based InSAR data processing workflow at National Taiwan University.
  Taught spatial analysis, numerical modeling, and environmental science courses at the University of Dundee.
  Conducted research on permafrost thawing and landslide dynamics at Cardiff University.
- #### Skills:
  Python, InSAR, geospatial data processing, machine learning, remote sensing, data analysis, and scientific computing.

Keywords: geospatial data science, remote sensing, Python, InSAR, data processing, machine learning, landform mapping, landslide dynamics, permafrost, environmental science, spatial analysis, numerical modeling.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects that involve processing geospatial data, creating infomrative maps and data visualization.
